    ? @change-log-info
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Change log is recorded with change id, denoted by: #change:xxxx-"description about change" where "xxxx" is a 4-digit hexadecimal. 
    The change id index is recorded under "@change-log" and is where all information about the change(s) are stored. Within the 
    document code, a change id is given near the sections of code that have been modified. The modified code is wrapped between two 
    comment lines that read:

        THIS    #change:xxxx-"description about change" // BEGIN // 
        AND         ...[[code affected by change]]...
        THIS    #change:xxxx-"description about change" \\ END \\

    Other non-specific changes worth documenting will be listed below "OTHER:" within each change-log record.
