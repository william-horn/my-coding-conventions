-- What Is This? --

This change log system was developed to help keep track of changes made to a program file whether for independent work
or for collaborative work. The goal was to reduce comment clutter in a program file while still keeping a descriptive log 
of changes made TO that program file stored away in a different file. 


-- How Do I Use This? --

Recording a change made to a document (using this system) is done by creating a "change record". A change record is a plain-text
entry within the local changelog file. Each directory containing a program file that wishes to keep a changelog will have a 
folder called "changelog" inside of it. Inside this folder are text files that are named after the program file it is tracking. 
So, if a program file is named "index.html", then its changelog file will be named "changelog_index(html).txt" which is inside 
of the changelog folder. The hierarchy will look something like this:


    <Program File Directory>
        |
        |__program-file.html 
        |
        |__changelog
            |
            |__changelog_program-file(html).txt


There will only be one changelog folder per directory. Tracking another program file does not require creating another changelog 
folder.

Once the files are established you can start making change records. As mentioned before, change records are just text entries
to the changelog files. However, they follow a specific format. They are instantiated by writing:


    @changelog-record:change[<id>]
        [version 1]
            -   some description about the change here


Here is the above example broken down:


    '@changelog-record:change'  - an anchor tag that let's us know we're creating a new change record 
    '<id>'                      - a numeric value that represents the sequential number of change records 
    '[version 1]'               - sometimes you make a change to a change, and it's not worth thinking about it in a different 
                                  context. in cases like these, you can create a new version of the change listed below the
                                  change record.


All change records should have a '[version 1]' when created, even if it is the only version of that change. Here is an example of
how some change records might look within the context of a project:


    @changelog-record:change[1]
        [version 1]
            -   changed header of website from X to Y 
            -   updated color scheme

        [version 2]
            -   reverted to old color scheme

    @changelog-record:change[2]
        [version 1]
            -   changed footer of website from X to Y


All of these change records are grouped and sorted by date. The date is displayed at the far right of the delimiter lines, and 
looks something like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                    | @changelog-date:xx/xx/xxxx |
                                                                                                    ------------------------------
    @changelog-record:change[id]
        [version 1]
            -   did this
            -   did that 

        [version 2]
            -   did that  
            -   did this


(*optional) OTHER:
                - general change #1
                - general change #2

(*optional) TODO:
                - do this
                - and that

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Notice that the date is prefixed with the anchor tag '@changelog-date:`, this means you can also search for groups of change
records by date. You will also notice there is an 'OTHER:' and 'TODO:' list below the change records. These lists are optional 
and should not be visible by default. They exist to write down a change you made that isn't worth creating a change record for,
but you would like to remember it anyway. Think of "OTHER" and "TODO" as sticky notes.


-- Using Change Records in Your Program File --

All of the information above is just for creating a change record directly in the changelog folder, completely hidden away from 
the main program file. However, you may also write these change record comments within your program file if the change you made 
affects a block of code that you want to track. This is optional, but encouraged when refactoring your own code or working with
other developers.

Instead of copying and pasting the change record from the changelog file over to the program file (which would just defeat
the purpose of all of this), there is a special variation of the '@changelog-record:change[<id>]' anchor which is:


    @changelog-record:change[<id>]:start


This anchor tag is specifically designed for being used within your program file to leave as a comment near the affected area 
of code. For example, consider the follow block of code below (this would be in one of your program files):


    var x = 0

    while (x < 10) {
        x++;
    }


Now let's say you want to record and track changes for some region of that code. You could do so by wrapping the affected
code within the change record comment:


    var x = 0

    /* @changelog-record:change[1]:start */
    while (x < 10) {
        x+=2;
    }
    /* @changelog-record:end */


'@changelog-record:end' is where you stop tracking the change record. There are two added benefits to 
doing this:


    1.  Searching for change records with your text editor's search function will now also show you where in the program 
        file the change was made, in addition to locating the information about the change in the changelog file.
    
    2.  While you're in your program file you will be able to see what code you changed without needing to switch
        immediately to your changelog file.
        

If no end anchor tag is given, you can simply leave the comment as `@changelog-record:change[<id>]:start` and 
treat it as an inline anchor tag reference. Usually you may want to do this if you're only changing one line of code, but
block anchors are still recommended.

That's all for now!
