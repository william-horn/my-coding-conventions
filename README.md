# My Coding Conventions

This repository was intended for my own self-reference regarding the coding conventions I use. Here you will find program files containing information about how I write, structure, and organize code in each of their respective languages. This is not to demonstrate a "right" or "wrong" way to compose code, but rather the consistency in which I do so.

This repository is a work in progress and is not complete.
