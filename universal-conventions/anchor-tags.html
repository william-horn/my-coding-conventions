    Another useful convention is the '@' tag. These tags are purposefully added so that you may search for special information about 
    the document with your text editor's built-in search function. This may also make parsing the document for specific information 
    easier. Simply open the search feature, type '@<inquiry here>`, and it should locate the inquiry within the document.
    
    The typical search tags are as follows, but depending on the purpose of the document there may be more or less:

    @author                         ! Locate author(s) of the document
    @document                       ! Locate the header of the document
    @document-created               ! Locate the date the document was created on
    @document-modified              ! Locate the date the document was last changed
    @document-version               ! Locate the version of the document according to the author(s)
    @document-about                 ! Locate verbose information about the document
    @document-api                   ! Locate the API if the document is a library
    @document-changelog             ! Locate information about the changelog if applicable
    @document-changelog-detailed    ! Locate information about the detailed changelog if applicable
    @document-todo                  ! Locate the document to-do list
    @main                           ! Points to the main function of the document
    @metadata                       ! Points to the metadata (or setup phase) of the document
    @debug                          ! Points to a debug comment left within a document
    @changelog-record               ! Points to a specific change log record within a document
    @changelog-date:xx/xx/xxxx      ! Points to a specific change log tab for a given date
    @changelog-records              ! Points to the change log repository for a document
