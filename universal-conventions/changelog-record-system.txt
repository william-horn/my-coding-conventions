| ABOUT CHANGE LOG |
==================================================================================================================================

This change log document was developed in order to for me to keep track of changes and updates made to my code within a separate,
accessible document for possible future reference. Whenever a note-worthy change is made to a line or section of code, a
"change record" can be written next to the modified area via a comment. The comment will look something like this:


    comment ->  #change-record:[id.version]-"short description about change"


If the modified code only affects a single line, you may see a change record comment like this:


    comment ->  #change-record:[id.version]-"short description about change" // BEGIN-END \\
                [... line of affected code ...]


Or like this:


    [... line of affected code ...]  comment -> #change-record:[id.version]-"short description about change" // BEGIN-END \\


If the modified code affects multiple lines in the program, then that region should be wrapped within an open-close change record
comment. Such a case should look like this:


    comment ->  #change-record:[id.version]-"short description about change" // BEGIN //
                [[... multiple lines of affected mode ...]]
    comment ->  #change-record:[id.version]-"short description about change" \\ END \\


The use case above will likely be the most common use case. When a change record is first written, its identifier is
located within the square brackets [id.version]. The first number in this identifier is the unique id of the change. This
is a sequential, hexadecimal number following the previous change id. The second number is the version of the change. For example,
if you modify some code in the same spot multiple times, the change id will remain the same but the change version number will 
increase. Example:


    comment ->  #change-record:[1.0]-"changed something here" // BEGIN //
                [[... changed some code here ...]]
    comment ->  #change-record:[1.0]-"changed something here" \\ END \\ 

    ... later on to the same code ...

    comment ->  #change-record:[1.1]-"updated change" // BEGIN //
                [[... changed some code here AGAIN ...]]
    comment ->  #change-record:[1.1]-"updated change" \\ END \\ 

The initial change record had an identifier of [1.0], but after another change was made within the same record its version was
updated and the new identifier is [1.1]. In the actual change records log kept below, initial change records are organized by
date. However, if an initial change record is added on day X and a version update is made to that same record on day Y, the new
date of that version is not recorded. Only the initial creation of the change record is recorded. This is to keep a nice linear
flow to the search history of change records, and change version dates are not deemed significant.

Each individual change record will be kept in a tab sorted by the date it was created on. The tab looks like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                    | @changelog-date:xx/xx/xxxx |
                                                                                                    ------------------------------
    @changelog-record:#change:[id.current-version]
        [id.(version - 1)]-"old change version"

            -   some change made a while ago

        [id.current-version]-"new change made"

            -   current change is now this

    @changelog-record:#change:[(id + 1).current-version]

        [(id + 1).current-version]-"changed how something worked"

            -   this is the current and only version of this change made 

    OTHER:
        - general change #1
        - general change #2

    TODO: 
        - do this
        - and that

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a change log tab created on xx/xx/xxxx with two record entries:

    @changelog-record:#change:[id.current-version]
    @changelog-record:#change:[(id + 1).current-version]

The first entry has two versions:

    @changelog-record:#change:[id.current-version]
        [id.(version - 1)]-"old change version"
        [id.current-version]-"new change made"

Below each of these identifiers contains addition information about the change that was made to the code and why. If you want to
locate a specific change within the document, search for @changelog-record:#change[identifier] where the identifier is
the change id and the version number.

There is also an "OTHER:" and "TODO:" category at the end of the tab. This is to record any addition changes made that were 
not worthy of creating a searchable change record for, and if there are any "todo" notes that should be saved.
